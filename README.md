# Linux-Setup-and-Maintenance-Scripts
This is a collect of scripts I've written to help automate the setup and deployment of Linux Workstations for new users. Be sure to double check each of the scripts yourself before you execute them. 

In most cases, the scripts perform multiple functions (some contradicting eachother) depending on which lines you un/comment ;)
