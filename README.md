# Linux-Setup-and-Maintenance-Scripts
This is a collect of scripts I've written to help automate the setup and deployment of Linux Workstations for new users. Be sure to double check yourself before you execute them. In most cases, each script has multiple functions depending on which lines you un/comment ;)
